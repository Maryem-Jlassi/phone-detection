# phone-detection
This project uses YOLOv8 for real-time mobile phone detection in images and videos. It is trained on a custom dataset of mobile phones, allowing accurate detection with high confidence. This tool can be applied in fields like security, surveillance, and mobile inventory management.

# Mobile Detection with YOLOv8

This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) to detect mobile phones in images and video streams. The model is trained on a custom dataset and can recognize phones with high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model contains images of mobile phones. You can access and download the dataset from my Google Drive:

- [Mobile Detection Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/your-dataset-link)

**Dataset Details:**
- The dataset includes labeled images of mobile phones.
- The images are split into training, validation, and test sets.
- The class label for the mobile phones is `phone`.
